RUTA is a simple route optimization web-app powered by Google Maps, meant to be used as an additional feature for Google Maps. Simply enter all the destinations you want to visit, and it will link you to a Google Maps page with the fastest route!

# Features
- Given a start, destination, and list of stops, it will display and export to Google Maps the fastest route between start & end that includes all intermediary waypoints.

__Planned__:
- Users can input their ideal departure time to include factors like traffic into their route calculation.
- Addresses will support auto-fill/auto-correct.

## Motivation
The inspiration behind Ruta came from the challenge of coordinating the fastest routes between numerous destinations. These instances include: having to run errands and not knowing where to start, coordinating ride-shares for people from unfamiliar locations, or discovering a new city with only a rough list of popular attractions. We thought it would be helpful to have a platform that could assist with visually understanding the best path.

This project was initially built for SLO Hacks Go 2019.
